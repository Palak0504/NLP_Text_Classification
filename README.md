# Transfer Learning with Pre-trained VGG16

This repository contains a Google Colab implementation of **transfer learning** using a **pre-trained VGG16** model on the **UEH-VDR (Vietnamese Dish Recognition)** dataset.  
It demonstrates how to adapt powerful existing models for new classification tasks quickly and effectively.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Pre-trained VGG16**: Loaded from PyTorch's torchvision models.
- **Fine-tuning**: Modified the classifier to match the number of classes in the new dataset.
- **Data Augmentation**: Random transformations applied to improve model robustness.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilized Google Colab GPU for faster training.
- **Visualization**: Displayed model predictions on sample test images.
